Note that there are three variants of this index:

+ `msmarco-v2-passage` (45G uncompressed): the "default" version, which stores term frequencies and the raw text. This supports bag-of-words queries, but no phrase queries and no relevance feedback.
+ `msmarco-v2-passage-slim` (11G uncompressed): the "slim" version, which stores term frequencies only. This supports bag-of-words queries, but no phrase queries and no relevance feedback. There is no way to fetch the raw text from this index.
+ `msmarco-v2-passage-full` (69G uncompressed): the "full" version, which stores term frequencies, term positions, document vectors, and the raw text. This supports bag-of-words queries, phrase queries, and relevance feedback.

This is the "full" version.
